# üåø Image Classification App (CNN + FastAPI + React)

This is a full-stack web application for image classification built with:
- A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**
- A **FastAPI backend** that serves the model and handles prediction requests
- A **React frontend** for uploading images and displaying predictions

The app predicts the **class of an uploaded image** and returns the **confidence score**.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Upload an image via a clean and simple React interface
- FastAPI handles image preprocessing and model inference
- Model returns:
  - Predicted class label
  - Confidence score (as a percentage)
- Realtime response and feedback

## üß† Model Overview

- Built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**
- Architecture: **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- Trained on a custom image dataset with multiple classes
- Includes preprocessing layers like `Rescaling`, `Resizing`, and data augmentation
